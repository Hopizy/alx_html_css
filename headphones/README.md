# Responsive Web Page

This project is a fully responsive webpage designed based on a Figma prototype. It adapts seamlessly across screen sizes and includes custom styles and interaction behaviors defined in the original design.

## 📱 Responsiveness

- The layout automatically switches to **mobile view** when the screen width is **480px or less**.
- Uses modern **CSS media queries** for responsive behavior.
- Content is constrained to a **max-width of 1000px**, centered on the page.

---

## 🎯 Interactions

- **Links**
  - `:hover` and `:active` states use the color: `#FF6565`

- **Buttons**
  - `:hover` and `:active` states use: `opacity: 0.9`

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Ensure internet access to load external fonts (or install locally).
4. Resize your browser to test mobile responsiveness at `≤ 480px`.

## 💡 Developer Notes

- Some Figma values are floats (e.g., `13.6px`). Feel free to **round them to the nearest pixel**.
- Styling is primarily managed in `styles.css`.
- Clean, semantic HTML5 is used throughout.
